<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>All of us who participate in any way in the Festival Reservoir recognize the right of all parties
to a fair, courteous and respectful treatment, and we see it as our task to actively contribute
to a friendly, safe and welcoming environment. We advocate that people with the most
diverse backgrounds can be involved in the festival.
</p>
<p>
We seek cooperation, avoid conflicts, and refrain from degrading, discriminatory or harassing
language and behavior, especially any form of unwanted physical contact, deliberate
intimidation, stalking or following or harassing photography or recording. We do not
discriminate against people because of their appearance, origin, gender, belief, political
attitudes, age, physical constitution, sexual orientation or any other personal characteristics.
</p>
<p>
We are committed to a responsible and sustainable use of natural resources and are
committed to the protection of the environment. We are committed to ensuring that the venue
is left in perfect condition after the festival, and we are helping to ensure that garbage,
leftovers and cigarette butts end up in the designated containers.
</p>
<p>
We do not tolerate unacceptable behavior by any party, including sponsors and those with
decision-making authority, and ask event organizers to take appropriate action if participants
behave in an unacceptable manner, including a temporary or permanent exclusion from the
festival site, without warning and reimbursement of costs. If we are affected by unacceptable
behavior or observe it, we will notify it as soon as possible to a person in charge, i.e. a
member of the festival organization or security staff on site.
</p>
<p>
If we are asked to stop unacceptable behavior, we will do so immediately and if we are
wrongly or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, we will address a person in
charge who will then handle the complaint in accordance with existing policies, with a
detailed description of our complaint.
</p>
<p>
We agree to abide by this Code of Conduct and to work with the other parties to enforce it. If
we notice any violations of this Code of Conduct before or during the Festival, we will alert a
person in charge, even if they seem irrelevant to us at first.
